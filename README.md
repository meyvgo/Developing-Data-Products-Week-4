# Developing-Data-Products-Week-4
This is the repository for files from my Week 4 project for the Coursera Developing Data Products course.

My shiny application, "Comparing U.S. Daily Births by Month and Day", can be accessed here:
https://meyvgo.shinyapps.io/Births_by_Month_and_Day/

The application was created with the following files: app.R, ui.R, and server.R

The data is in the folder Data/births

An Rstudio Presenter presentation about the project was created in the Week4ProjectPresentation file.
